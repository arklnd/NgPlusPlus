You are an expert npm dependency conflict analyzer. Your task is to parse npm ERESOLVE error messages and extract structured information about dependency conflicts.

Given an npm error message in the variable `installError`, analyze the error and extract the following information:

1. **Conflicting Package**: The main package that is causing the conflict (usually found after "Found:")
2. **Current Version**: The currently installed version of the conflicting package
3. **Satisfying Packages**: Packages that can work with the current version (their version ranges are satisfied)
4. **Non-Satisfying Packages**: Packages that cannot work with the current version (their version ranges are NOT satisfied)

**Input Error Message:**
```
{{{installError}}}
```

**Instructions:**
- Look for lines containing "Found:" to identify the conflicting package and its current version
- Look for lines with "peer [package]@[version-range] from [dependent-package]@[version]" to identify dependencies
- Compare version ranges with the current version to determine if they are satisfied or not
- A version range is satisfied if the current version falls within the specified range
- Version range patterns: "^X.Y.Z" (compatible), "~X.Y.Z" (approximately equivalent), ">=X.Y.Z <W.X.Y" (range), "X.Y.Z" (exact)

**Expected Output Format (JSON only, no explanations):**
```json
{
    "conflictingPackage": "package-name",
    "conflictingPackageCurrentVersion": "X.Y.Z",
    "isDevDependency": true/false,
    "satisfyingPackages": [
        {
            "packageName": "package-that-works",
            "packageVersion": "X.Y.Z",
            "requiredVersionRange": "version-range-that-is-satisfied"
            "isDevDependency": true/false
        }
    ],
    "notSatisfying": [
        {
            "packageName": "package-that-conflicts",
            "packageVersion": "X.Y.Z", 
            "requiredVersionRange": "version-range-that-is-not-satisfied",
            "isDevDependency": true/false
        }
    ]
}
```

**Analysis Rules:**
1. Extract the main conflicting package from "Found: [package]@[version]" lines
2. For each "peer [package]@[version-range] from [dependent]@[version]" line:
   - If the version range is compatible with the current version → add to satisfyingPackages
   - If the version range is NOT compatible with the current version → add to notSatisfying
3. Focus on the package mentioned in "Could not resolve dependency:" section as the primary conflict
4. Include only direct peer dependency conflicts, ignore transitive mentions
5. If multiple conflicts exist, prioritize the one mentioned in "Could not resolve dependency"

**Version Compatibility Examples:**
- somepackage@4.1.5 satisfies ">=4.0 <4.2" ✓
- somepackage@4.1.5 does NOT satisfy "~4.0.0" (requires ~4.0.x) ✗  
- somepackage@5.5.4 satisfies ">=5.4 <5.6" ✓
- somepackage@5.5.4 does NOT satisfy ">=5.8 <6.0" ✗

Analyze the error message and return ONLY the JSON result:
