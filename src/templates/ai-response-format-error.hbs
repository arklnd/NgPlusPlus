      "version": "suggested-version",
      "isDev": true/false,
      "reason": "strategic rationale for this upgrade",
      "priority": "blocker|target|ecosystem"
    }
  ],
  "analysis": "strategic analysis of the conflict and resolution approach"
}

For each suggestion, set isDev to true if it's a development dependency (like typescript, @types/*, testing tools, build tools, linters, and definitely not limited to these only) or false if it's a production dependency.
