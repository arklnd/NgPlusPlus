⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE: No New Suggestions Detected**

Your previous response suggested changes, but when applied to package.json, the file remained **completely unchanged**. This indicates one or more of the following problems:

**Possible Root Causes:**
1. **Redundant Suggestions**: You suggested versions that were already present in package.json
2. **Ineffective Strategy**: The suggested changes don't actually address the dependency conflict
3. **Misidentified Target**: You may have misunderstood which packages need modification

**Error Details:**
{{errorMessage}}

**REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:**

**Step 1: Verify Current State**
- Review the CURRENT package.json state that was just shown
- Identify which versions are ALREADY present
- DO NOT suggest versions that already exist in the file

**Step 2: Analyze the Actual Conflict**
- Re-read the npm install error carefully
- Identify the BLOCKING package causing the conflict
- Determine which package versions are incompatible

**Step 3: Generate DIFFERENT Suggestions**
You MUST provide suggestions that are:
✅ **Different from current versions** - Verify against the current package.json
✅ **Valid npm versions** - Must exist in the npm registry
✅ **Conflict-resolving** - Must address the specific peer dependency or version conflict
✅ **Strategic** - Prioritize changes to lower-ranked (less important) dependencies

**Step 4: Think Strategically**
- **Alternative versions**: If specific versions fail, try adjacent minor/patch versions

**NOW RESPOND WITH:**
A JSON object containing GENUINELY DIFFERENT suggestions that will modify package.json and resolve the conflict. Double-check that your suggestions are not already present in the current state.
